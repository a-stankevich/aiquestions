</ol>
<ol>
   <li> Name this common mafic and fine-grained extrusive igneous rock that is low in silica.

<p>A man elbows you out of the way while you are entering a convenience store, which makes you think he is rude. For 10 points each:</p>
<ol>
   <li> Since the man is actually a paramedic trying to save a person's life inside, you have just shown a good example of this psychological phenomenon, which makes you think a person's internal disposition was the cause of their behavior rather than the situation.
   <br><i> fundamental attribution error [or FAE]</i>
   <li> This related phenomenon is the belief that if a bad thing happens to a person, then that person must be intrinsically bad, and if a good thing happens to a person, then that person must be intrinsically good.

<ol>
   <li> Name this book which, like its author's earlier Theory of Moral Sentiments, described the corrections of a relatively free market as an "invisible hand." It's by Adam Smith.
   <br><i> An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>

</ol>
<p>You are a Marxist. Explain some doctrines that you believe in,</p>
<ol>
   <li> You model society according to a metaphor in which a society's means of production form its "base". Built on that base are all ideological and cultural relations, which form this concept.
   <br><i> superstructure [or Ã¼berbau]</i>
   <li> You believe that there is is a subsection of the working class, including criminals, which will never achieve class consciousness; you call them by this term.

   <br><i> lumpenproletariat [prompt on "proletariat"]</i>
   <li> You believe that because different people's relations of production are at different stages, individuals do not have synchronous experiences of the "Now". That concept of "non-simultaneity" was developed by this German Marxist author of The Principle of Hope.

   <br><i> pigs [or hogs, swine, or various other synonyms; do not accept "boar"]</i>
   <li>  In The Rise of Anthropological Theory, Marvin Harris coined this term for his research orientation based on etic explanations of culture in terms of adaptations to practical problems, like ecological constraints.
   <br><i> cultural materialism</i>
   <li> In Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches, Harris explains these Melanesian religious movements as a response to inequality resulting from colonialism. A noted one of these movements venerates a GI named John Frum.

   <br><i> John Bargh</i>
   <li> Many priming tasks cause decreased activity in this outermost structure of the brain, which comprises the gray matter. It is divided into functional regions called Brodmann areas.
   <br><i> cerebral cortex</i>

   <br><i> Sheilaism</i>
</ol>
<p>Diamond and Dybvig model these events as liquidity crises arising from stochastic timing of the desire to consume.</p>
<ol>
   <li> Charles Kindleberger and others argued for a lender of last resort to stave off these events, where depositors worried about a bank's solvency withdraw their deposits even if they don't need the money themselves.
   <br><i> bank run</i>
   <li> One of the earliest proponents of a lender of last resort was this author of Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market. He was the editor of The Economist for most of the 1860s and 70s.
   <br><i> Walter Bagehot</i>
   <li> One critique of the Diamond and Dybvig model is that it suffers from this indeterminacy, since it has no way of predicting whether a run will or won't actually happen. Roger Myerson has argued that this situation is characteristic of the world, rather than a modeling flaw, and Schelling's concept of a "focal point" is one way around this situation.

<ol>
   <li> This term denotes the total market value of goods and services produced within a country.
   <br><i> gross domestic product or GDP [do not accept "GNP" or "GDP per capita"]</i>
   <li> This theory holds that currency exchange rates will approach the ratio of prices of identical goods and services in two countries. It can convert GDP between currencies to avoid discrepancies from fluctuating exchange rates.
   <br><i> purchasing power parity [accept PPP]</i>
   <li> The price of this corporation's core product is used by The Economist to calculate ideal exchange rates based on PPP. Thomas Friedman suggested that no two countries with one of these stores would go to war with each other

<ol>
   <li> Identify this author of "Lenin's Heir" and The Managerial Revolution.
   <br><i> James Burnham</i>
   <li> Burnham's follow-up to The Managerial Revolution focuses on contemporary Machiavellians like this Italian economist and his theory of the "circulation of the elites". This Italian's namesake 80/20 principle is often trotted out business books on Six Sigma.
   <br><i> Vilfredo Pareto [or Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto]</i>

</ol>
<p>A zero-sum one of these occurs when the gains of one competitor are negated by the losses of others.</p>
<ol>
   <li> Name these hypothetical situations created by a namesake study of decision making. In these constructs, exemplified by the prisoner's dilemma, rational beings cooperate and compete with each other.
   <br><i> games</i>
   <li> In game theory, a dominant strategy for a player is one which is this type of response to all of his opponent's strategies.
   <br><i> it is the best response to all the opponent's strategies [accept any answer indicating that the dominant strategy has an optimal payoff for the player no matter which strategy his opponent chooses; do not accept an answer that is less specific]</i>
   <li> This equilibrium can be used to predict the outcome of a non-cooperative game. In this state, no player can benefit by changing his own strategy, assuming the other player's strategy remains unchanged.
   <br><i> Nash equilibrium</i>
</ol>
<ol>
   <li> Identify this usually-concave graph from economics, the most famous example of which plots guns versus butter.
   <br><i> the production possibilities frontier [or production possibilities curve; or production possibilities boundary; or PPF; or PPC; or PPB]</i>
   <li> When the marginal rate of transformation is equal to all marginal rates of substitution, the PPF exhibits this optimality, which is named for an Italian economist and in which no individual can be made better off without making another individual worse off.
   <br><i> Pareto efficiency [or Pareto optimality]</i>
   <li> The PPF can be derived by plotting the outputs of the two involved firms on one of these constructs, a plot of the set of Pareto-optimal allocations contained in an Edgeworth box.
   <br><i> a contract curve</i>
</ol>
<p>This NYU professor developed the "social intuitionist" model of moral reasoning, propounded in his article "The Emotional Dog and His Rational Tail."</p>
<ol>
   <li> Name this man, who argues that moral judgments are based on intuition, with rational ethical positions adopted post-hoc. He is the author of The Righteous Mind.
   <br><i> Jonathan (David) Haidt ["Height" is the correct pronunciation, but be generous]</i>
   <li> Haidt was criticized by this leading New Atheist and author of The End of Faith for observing the higher satisfaction and generosity of religious people, which Haidt intends as a retort to this man's argument that the Bible and Koran are immoral for advocating doing harm.
   <br><i> (Samuel B.) "Sam" Harris</i>
   <li> Haidt cites this Harvard myrmecologist and founder of sociobiology as a critic of rational morality. This man proposed the idea of the "Evolutionary Epic," science's response to the human need for a larger narrative previously filled by religious epics.

</ol>
<p>This man wrote a 1980 article with Sanford Grossman entitled "On the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets."</p>
<ol>
   <li> Name this economist, who showed in that article that a competitive equilibrium in an asset market could not exist with costly-but-accurate information since the price would convey information and therefore make paying for it sub-optimal.
   <br><i> Joseph Stiglitz</i>
   <li> That article is a critique of this concept, which at the time held that asset prices always reflect all available information. Subsequent refinements of this concept have made it either false or tautological.
   <br><i> Efficient Markets Hypothesis (or EMH; accept "strong" or "weak" if anyone adds that because the clue is intentionally ambiguous between the two.)</i>
   <li> An entirely different critique of EMH from complexity theory was proposed by Philip Maymin, who showed that markets are efficient if and only if [this statement]. Since this statement is probably not correct, markets are probably not efficient because they cannot be an algorithm capable of solving a sufficiently complex problem.

</ol>
<p>Samuel Preston showed this variable for newborns increases concavely with income.</p>
<ol>
   <li> Name this value, which for a given age is the average total years of life.
   <br><i> life expectancy</i>
   <li> This economist claimed increased life expectancy and other physiological changes were due entirely to public health factors in The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100. He more controversially argued slavery was efficient and profitable in Time on the Cross, co-authored with Stanley Engerman.
   <br><i> Robert (William) Fogel</i>
   <li> This two-word concept refers to the multi-stage process by which life expectancy increases with economic and social development, giving rise to lower birth and mortality rates. Investment in public health and the adoption of contraception are both components of this concept.

</ol>
<p>Diamond and Dybvig model these events as liquidity crises arising from stochastic timing of the desire to consume.</p>
<ol>
   <li> Charles Kindleberger and others argued for a lender of last resort to stave off these events, where depositors worried about a bank's solvency withdraw their deposits even if they don't need the money themselves.
   <br><i> bank run</i>
   <li> One of the earliest proponents of a lender of last resort was this author of Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market. He was the editor of The Economist for most of the 1860s and 70s.
   <br><i> Walter Bagehot</i>
   <li> One critique of the Diamond and Dybvig model is that it suffers from this indeterminacy, since it has no way of predicting whether a run will or won't actually happen. Roger Myerson has argued that this situation is characteristic of the world, rather than a modeling flaw, and Schelling's concept of a "focal point" is one way around this situation.
   <br><i> multiple equilibria [accept equivalents, including specifically "two equilibria"]</i>
</ol>
<p>Answer some questions about tort law, </p>
<ol>
   <li> Tort law and the law of these entities both usually involve duties that may be breached. They differ in that these entities involve a formal agreement, either written or oral, between two or more parties.

<ol>
   <li> Name this neurological condition. The "broken mirrors" hypothesis posits people develop it when mirror neurons fail before or during infancy.
   <br><i>  autism</i>
   <li> Baron-Cohen used this experiment to test for a theory of mind, in which one of the namesake dolls places a marble in a basket and the other moves it to a box when the first isn't looking. Most autistic children said the first doll would look for the marble in the box rather than the basket.
   <br><i> Sally-Anne test</i>
   <li> One proposed cause for the rise in the prevalence of autism-spectrum disorders is an increase in the efficiency of this process in the marriage market, because spouses who are outliers in their genetic endowment for mathematical reasoning are more likely to marry one another.
   <br><i> assortative matching or mating [accept word forms]</i>
</ol>
<p>This philosopher outlined an understanding of gender in terms of "performativity" in her essay Performative Acts and Gender Constitution. </p>

<ol>
   <li> What is this statistical concept, which may arise when a sample is not drawn randomly from the population?
   <br><i>  bias [accept word forms and more specific answers: "sampling bias," for example]</i>
   <li> This type of bias arises because the data are generated by agents who make decisions. For instance, the observed wage distribution does not include the "latent" wages of those outside the labor force, so the data is not a random sample.
   <br><i> selection bias</i>
   <li> Selection bias is a major issue in estimates of this data object, the parameter of interest in most applications of the "Mincer equation." This data object can potentially be compared to the market interest rate to test for over- or- under-investment in human capital.
